*   **Language:** Transcribe *exactly* what is said in the original language of the audio.
*   **Accuracy:** Prioritize accuracy in transcription. Even with poor audio quality, make your best attempt.

*   **Formatting:** Present the transcription as a single, continuous block of text. Do not include introductory phrases.
*   **Non-Speech Sounds:** Include descriptions of significant non-speech sounds within square brackets \`[]\`.
*   **Handling Uncertainty:** Mark uncertain words with a question mark \`?\`.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** After the transcription, perform a sentiment analysis. Identify the overall sentiment expressed in the audio as one of the following: "Positive," "Negative," "Neutral," or "Mixed."  Also, identify *specific* phrases that contribute to that sentiment.
*   **Sentiment Detail:** For each identified sentiment phrase, briefly explain *why* it contributes to the overall sentiment. (e.g., "The phrase 'Estoy muy contento' expresses positive emotion due to the use of 'muy contento'.")
*   **Recommendations for Improvement:** Based on the sentiment analysis, provide 2-3 actionable recommendations for improving the speaker's communication style. These recommendations should be specific and practical.  Consider aspects like tone, clarity, and emotional impact.  Frame recommendations as suggestions, not criticisms.
